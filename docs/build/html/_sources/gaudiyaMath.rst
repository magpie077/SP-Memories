Gaudiya Math
============

1st time visit to Calcutta
--------------------------
**Jayapataka Swami:** Somehow we contacted a doctor who had just built a new house that he was going to make into a clinic. No one had moved in it yet. The doctor thought, "I will give it to you for six months. It will be auspicious for some sadhus to come and stay in my new house." Then we had a place to invite Prabhupada. In the meantime Prabhupada had left America and gone to Japan. We sent him a message that we had a separate place for him. Prabhupada said, "I am coming," and we arranged for a big reception at the Calcutta airport. The media was there, and a whole truckload of Gaudiya Vaishnava devotees came to receive Prabhupada with kirtan.
We invited all of Prabhupada's God-brothers. We said, "Who would like to come and receive him?" because he was a conquering Gaudiya Vaishnava missionary who had successfully spread Krishna consciousness in places where no one had even ventured before, and now he was returning. One God-brother, Puri Maharaj, said, "Oh yes. I would like to go." At that time I didn't know much about the internal workings between the different Gaudiya Math people. But a grihastha devotee came up and said to Puri Maharaj, "Maharaj, how can you go? You are an older God-brother. You took initiation before Bhaktivedanta Swami did. You took sannyas before he did. You cannot go to him, he should come to you." I said, "What does it matter if you were initiated earlier or later? Someone has done wonderful preaching."
In the end none of Prabhupada's God-brothers came to the airport to meet him, but some disciples of his God-brothers came. Prabhupada noted that and was not very happy that none of his God-brothers had come. Then one of his God-brother's disciples said, "Your God-brother is waiting for you at his temple. He has a feast for you there. He wants you to go from the airport to his temple." Prabhupada became very grave and said, "Let us go in the car." Before that we had had a big reception, a press conference, and an arati in the VIP lounge. Prabhupada didn't have to go through any customs or immigration, he went straight to the VIP lounge and then came out and went to the car. We had a big American car from a Life Member for him, and Prabhupada got in it and said, "Take me to the house. I will not go to my God-brother's temple. You can go later and bring the prasadam that they've made to the house. We will go straight to our house."

Not Bonafide SM
---------------
**Govinda:** When we were in Montreal, Achyutananda was in India with a young brahmachari named Hrishikesh. Somehow or other Hrishikesh had gone to Bon Maharaj's ashram and been reinitiated by Bon Maharaj. Prabhupada was extremely upset by this. I didn't understand why, and he explained, "This boy is American. He does not know anything, so it's not his fault. He's a foolish youth. But Bon Maharaj is responsible. He knows that by doing this is he is saying that I am not a bonafide spiritual master." I had never seen Prabhupada that upset. He was dealing with a kind of Vaishnava etiquette that I didn't understand.
