Give us everything!
-------------------
**Atma Tattva:** One big businessman said, "Swamiji, I have a factory here in Delhi, and I have a factory in Jaipur. . . ." He listed his things and said, "I have all this, but I can't sleep." Prabhupada said, "You can't sleep because you have so many things. Give them to me, then you can sleep peacefully," and he turned to somebody and said, "Take his address." The man said, "No Swamiji, I can come any time." "You can come any time, but we should also be able to go to you any time. Take his address." "No, No Swamiji." Prabhupada said, "If you give some of your things to Krishna, you will be peaceful. We will relieve you of your problem." The man was smashed right there, and he gave his address. He had to.

Who is old?
-----------
**Hridayananda Goswami:** At the end of July in 1971, Prabhupada came to Gainesville, Florida. He sat on the vyasasana that we had made for him, gave a beautiful lecture, and then took questions. There was a young girl there, and in a somewhat challenging tone she said to Prabhupada, "I see that you have mostly young people here. Why is that?" Prabhupada immediately shot back, "Why do you have mostly young people in your university?" She was so caught off guard that she dropped her pencil. She stuttered and said, "Well, that's the age for education." He said, "Yes, therefore that is the age for Krishna consciousness."
A few days before I took sannyas, a reporter was interviewing Prabhupada in his quarters in L.A. This reporter knew something about Hinduism. He said, "Well, isn't it old people that take sannyas in India? Why are you giving sannyas to young people?" Prabhupada shot back, "What does it mean to be old?" The man had no answer. Prabhupada said, "Old means about to die. Can you say that I am older than you? Can you say that you are not going to die before me?" He couldn't answer that. Prabhupada said, "Therefore, we are giving them sannyas."

This is my miracle
------------------
**Jayapataka Swami:** Once Prabhupada was sitting in his room in Calcutta when a Life Member businessman said, "Can you show us some miracle?" Prabhupada said, "Some yogis show a miracle by creating some rasgula. I went to America with forty rupees, and in a short span we now have temples all over the world worth more than 400 million rupees. Isn't that a miracle?" The businessman thought for a minute and said, "That's a miracle."

Vegetable basket
----------------
**Jayapataka Swami:** We were walking near the river Jalangi one day when a villager came by with a big basket of vegetables on his head. Srila Prabhupada asked, "Are you going to sell those in the market?" He said, "Yes." Prabhupada said, "How much will you sell them for? Sell us the whole basket." Prabhupada had been telling the devotees how he liked fresh garden vegetables, how we should offer our vegetables to the Deity, and how you can save money if you buy wholesale. Prabhupada started bargaining with the villager. He told him, "If you go to the market, you will spend the whole day sitting there with the basket. I will buy it from you right now. You can do something else. You won't have to walk two miles to the market and sell your goods." He bargained him down to six rupees for the basket. Then he said, "Go to the temple and they will pay you." The man went off with the basket, entered the temple and sold those vegetables. The devotees cooked them for the Deities and Prabhupada had them as well.
