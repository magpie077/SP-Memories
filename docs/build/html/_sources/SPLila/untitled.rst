Watch out SP!
-------------
**Jayapataka Swami:** Prabhupada was walking down the stairway in Calcutta. Many devotees were there. Prabhupada slipped a little bit, and it looked like he was going to fall down. One of the senior devotees said, "Watch out, Srila Prabhupada." Prabhupada stopped and said, "It is your responsibility to watch out. You have to take care of the body of the spiritual master. The spiritual master looks out for your spiritual well-being, but as far as whether I fall or not, that you have to guard against."


Kanishtha 
---------
**Jayapataka Swami:** We were on a morning walk with Srila Prabhupada in north Calcutta. Srila Prabhupada said, "Oh, here is a Life Member's home." For some reason Prabhupada wanted to stop in at the house of a wealthy Life Member. He went in and told the servant, "Tell your master that Bhaktivedanta Swami is here." After a while the servant came out and said, "The master is worshiping his Deity. He will be here after some time." Prabhupada commented, "Krishna is more pleased when the devotee is served than when He is served. If this person was more advanced he would have appreciated, 'A spiritual master has come,' and left his Deity worship to receive the devotee of Krishna. But because he thinks that his Deity worship is more important than receiving the devotee of Krishna, that shows that he is a neophyte, or kanistha adhikari."
