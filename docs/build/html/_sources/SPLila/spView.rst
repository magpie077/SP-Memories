Big bird
--------
**Badrinarayana:** There was a big statue of an American eagle to commemorate World War II soldiers. Prabhupada went out of his way to look at it. He said that there is a type of bird that flies from one planet to another that is so big that it could pick up an elephant and then drop it to kill it. Then this bird would eat the elephant. Prabhupada mentioned that because he saw the eagle statue.


SP World View
-------------
**Govinda:** Prabhupada described how the abominable snowman is a big demon that lives in the mountains and how he has big footprints. He explained how there are various entities deep in the ocean, up in the mountains, and in the dark jungles of Africa.
When you are fresh out of school you think that everything has already been discovered and taught. But Prabhupada made it very clear that that's not so, that there are a lot of things that we don't know about. We accepted his view of the world. It was interesting to hear the things that he came up with.

Moon Landing is side business
-----------------------------
**Badrinarayana:** Once he was looking through the newspaper about the moon shot. The headline stated, "One small step for man, one great step for mankind." Prabhupada flicked through and got to the fourth or fifth page where there was an article about how taxes were going up to pay for the space program. Prabhupada said, "This is their real business. They have made some scheme to squeeze money out of the innocent public. The moon expedition is just a side show."
