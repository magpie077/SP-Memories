Initiation Inspiration
======================

Connection to parampara
-----------------------
**Atma Tattva:** Everybody was singing Sri Guru Charana Padma while Prabhupada was on the vyasasana with his eyes closed, playing the kartals and singing. I asked Lokanath Swami, "Isn't this song glorifying Prabhupada?" He said, "Yes." I said, "How come he is singing?" He said, "He's singing it to his spiritual master." The day before Lokanath Swami had asked me to put my name in for initiation. I said, "I am not ready yet." After I heard this explanation from Lokanath Swami I said, "You include my name for initiation." He said, "Why now, all of a sudden? You always said, 'Wait, wait, wait,' and now you are ready?" I said, "Yes, I can see that he will be my spiritual master because when he is glorified, he glorifies his spiritual master. Now I know that this is actually part of the disciplic succession. Put my name down for initiation." My name was added, Swami Atmananda. I heard from other God-brothers that when Prabhupada was looking at the names for initiation he said, "Bhakta this, bhakta this, bhakta that," and then he said, "Swami? Who is this swami?" Someone told him "It's a new bhakta." Prabhupada said, "New bhakta, a swami? All right, what's his name, Atmananda?" Then Prabhupada said, "Apasyatam atma tattvam griheshu grihamedi-nam. His name will be Atma Tattva."
