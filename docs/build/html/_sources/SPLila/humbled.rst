Humbled by His Divine Grace
===========================

College preacher, eh?
---------------------
**Hridayananda Goswami:** Often I would enter Prabhupada's room in a serious mood, and he would sometimes joke with me. Once I went into his room with that serious mood, and he looked at me with mock seriousness, "Yes, what is your message?" Another time I was on a college preaching tour, and I went into his room in New York when he was finishing his breakfast. He was in a jolly mood. He said, "Oh! Hridayananda Maharaj, you are traveling and preaching. I am just here eating."
He was pleased with the college preaching tour, and we talked about it for a while. He gave me a little attention, so I was feeling very happy. "Prabhupada likes my program." But the next day I went into Prabhupada's room thinking, "Well here I am, the college preacher." I sat in front of Prabhupada, and he didn't speak to me. He was doing his business. But there was an innocent young brahmacharini there who was changing Prabhupada's flower vases with devotion. Prabhupada was very pleased with her. He was smiling like a loving grandfather. He said, "Thank you very much. What is your name?" So that day Prabhupada didn't have a word for me, but he was very pleased with the devotion of this young girl. I was a sannyasi, and she was just some innocent girl. But she's the one that pleased Prabhupada, because I was thinking, "I am a sannyasi," and she was an innocent girl serving with great devotion. I never forgot that lesson.

Dog for Krishna?
----------------
**Badrinarayana:** Karandhar told me that once Prabhupada was walking in Cheviot Hills, Los Angeles, when they went past a big house. Prabhupada said, "Someday we will have a big house like this for Krishna." The devotees said, "Jaya, Prabhupada!" Prabhupada walked a little further, and there was a big circular driveway with a big stretch limo. Prabhupada said, "Someday we will have a big car like this for Krishna." The devotees said, "Jaya, Prabhupada!" They walked past another house, and out of nowhere a dog came running down the driveway. Prabhupada said, "Someday we will have a big dog like this for Krishna." The devotees said, "Jaya, Prabhupada!" Prabhupada said, "You fools, what do you want a big dog for?"

Books are the basis
-------------------
**Badrinarayana:** A devotee was telling Srila Prabhupada that he was selling prasadam, Bengali sweets, at a stand in front of UC Berkeley. He was going on and on about this. Prabhupada stopped him and asked Tripurari, "How many books did you sell?" Tripurari told him some amazing figure. Prabhupada said, "This is the real Bengali sweet, Caitanya-caritamrta."

Take birth in India to finish KC
--------------------------------
**Govinda:** Srila Prabhupada said, "The problem is that the Western boys and girls often go to the other side." I asked, "What do you mean by 'the other side?' Do you mean that they go back to the way they were before they became devotees?" In other words, the tendency is that when devotees stop devotional service, they return to their previous lifestyle. He said, "Yes. They go as they were before. Therefore many of them will have to take birth in India to finish their Krishna consciousness."
