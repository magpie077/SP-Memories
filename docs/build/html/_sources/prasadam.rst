Prasadam
========

Get people to KC
----------------
**Hari Sauri:** Prabhupada explained that one of his strategies for making people Krishna conscious was to distribute profuse amounts of prasadam. He said that people are almost like animals in the way they live. They don't know anything other than their bodies. "At least let them eat prasadam, for that's also Krishna," he said. "Our program is to help people gradually become Krishna conscious. Simply by eating prasadam they'll gradually develop an attraction to Krishna, and when that develops, they'll be able to understand the philosophy simply by eating prasadam." Prasadam distribution was one definite way that people could make some advancement.

Everthing is there

**Govinda:** Several times when I brought Prabhupada's lunch plate in with subji, rice, dahl, and chapatis, he said, "When I was in India, everyone told me, 'Oh Swamiji, don't go to America. In America there will be no food for you. You will starve. They only eat meat in America.'" Back then there wasn't much interchange between India and America. Prabhupada said, "I simply told them, 'What is that? I shall live on bread and potatoes.' I thought I would be living on bread and potatoes, but now I see that Krishna has sent everything; dahl, rice, chapatis, subjis." He was amazed and happy about that.
