Prasadam
========

Get people to KC
----------------
**Hari Sauri:** Prabhupada explained that one of his strategies for making people Krishna conscious was to distribute profuse amounts of prasadam. He said that people are almost like animals in the way they live. They don't know anything other than their bodies. "At least let them eat prasadam, for that's also Krishna," he said. "Our program is to help people gradually become Krishna conscious. Simply by eating prasadam they'll gradually develop an attraction to Krishna, and when that develops, they'll be able to understand the philosophy simply by eating prasadam." Prasadam distribution was one definite way that people could make some advancement.

Everthing is there
------------------
**Govinda:** Several times when I brought Prabhupada's lunch plate in with subji, rice, dahl, and chapatis, he said, "When I was in India, everyone told me, 'Oh Swamiji, don't go to America. In America there will be no food for you. You will starve. They only eat meat in America.'" Back then there wasn't much interchange between India and America. Prabhupada said, "I simply told them, 'What is that? I shall live on bread and potatoes.' I thought I would be living on bread and potatoes, but now I see that Krishna has sent everything; dahl, rice, chapatis, subjis." He was amazed and happy about that.

Peanut oil
----------
**Badrinarayana:** Durlab, the temple President in Laguna Beach, was trying to save money and therefore used peanut oil for all the cooking. But the devotees wanted ghee and went on a nonviolent, non-cooperation strike. We said, "No more peanut oil." Durlab said, "I am going to ask Srila Prabhupada." He said, "Prabhupada, can we cook in peanut oil?" Prabhupada said, "This is not first class." Later on in the conversation Durlab asked again, "What about cooking in peanut oil?" Prabhupada said, "Peanut oil is fifth class." Finally he asked a third time. Prabhupada said, "Cook in anything you like." Durlab thought, "Oh! Great! We can cook in anything I like." As he was leaving Prabhupada said, "But I know one man who ate too many pakoras cooked in peanut oil." A devotee said, "What happened to him?" Prabhupada said, "He died the next morning." That was Prabhupada's purport on peanut oil and that was the end of peanut oil.

Not good for Sanyasis
---------------------
**Jayapataka Swami:** Once a Maharaj was cooking hot puris, and we were taking hot puris with date gur, date molasses. Prabhupada looked through the window and saw the sannyasis and brahmacharis taking hot puris with date gur one after another. He said, "This is not very good for sannyas life."
