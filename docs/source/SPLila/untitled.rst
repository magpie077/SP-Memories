Watch out SP!
-------------
**Jayapataka Swami:** Prabhupada was walking down the stairway in Calcutta. Many devotees were there. Prabhupada slipped a little bit, and it looked like he was going to fall down. One of the senior devotees said, "Watch out, Srila Prabhupada." Prabhupada stopped and said, "It is your responsibility to watch out. You have to take care of the body of the spiritual master. The spiritual master looks out for your spiritual well-being, but as far as whether I fall or not, that you have to guard against."
