Miss Mexico
-----------
**Hridayananda Goswami:** We brought Miss Mexico to see Srila Prabhupada. In those days we were young and brought any celebrity to Prabhupada. Miss Mexico spent her year doing events, smiling, saying a few nice words and getting her picture taken. She was more or less in that mood. She sat in front of Prabhupada and made her customary spiel, saying in Spanish that it was very nice being Miss Mexico and fluttering her eyelashes. I was translating. She said, "I am very glad to be here. I have enjoyed the program very much and I hope to come again sometime." Prabhupada said to her, "Why do you want to come again?" He was not at all concerned with the glamour of it. He was very sober. She couldn't really answer. No one asks questions like that to Miss Mexico. He asked her very seriously, "Why do you want to come? Have you read my books?" She said, "No." He said, "Then why do you want to come? Why do you say you want to come again?" So she was caught without an answer, and at that point she stopped being Miss Mexico and just started being a soul.

When the appetite comes, it must be fed
---------------------------------------
**Hari Sauri:** From Australia we went to New Zealand, but there was nobody who knew how to cook there. So for the first time I had to do the whole thing. I put the cooker on the flame, finished the massage, came back to the cooker, and everything was totally ruined. I had left the flame on too high. All the dahl had dried up at the bottom. The rice was like sludge. It had disintegrated. The vegetables were so soft they fell apart. There was nothing else to cook, and there was nobody else there to do a quick job of cooking either. So I had to serve what I had. When Prabhupada saw it, he was really disappointed. He said, "What is this?" I said, "I must have had the flame too high." Prabhupada said, "You are too dullâ€”you cannot cook." My first attempt was a disaster. I felt really bad. Prabhupada's digestive system was delicate, and it was important that he had a consistent diet. Otherwise he could have all kinds of physical problems.
Once Palika cooked in Calcutta and was about ten minutes late bringing Prabhupada his prasadam. He got angry about it and chastised her strongly. I hadn't seen him chastise one of his women disciples as strongly as that. He explained, "When the appetite comes, it must be fed. Otherwise disease comes."
When I was with him I regulated the time for serving his lunch prasadam to 1:30, regardless of when the massage ended. By 1:30 he expected his prasadam to be there. That meant that the thought of eating made the digestive juices in the stomach flow, and then you have to feed it. Otherwise there is disease. It was a science, and Prabhupada was aware of that. Apart from that, Prabhupada had problems digesting food anyway. It was important to give him a high standard of prasadam regularly. Unfortunately, I wasn't very good at cooking it.
