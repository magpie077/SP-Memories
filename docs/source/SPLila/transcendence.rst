Transcendence
=============

I never forgot Krishna
----------------------
**Hridayananda Goswami:** Karandhar and I were in Prabhupada's room in the early seventies. It was a beautiful afternoon, a breeze was blowing, the sun was setting and golden rays were shining on Prabhupada. It was a sublime atmosphere. Prabhupada began to talk about India at the turn of the century. He explained how people used to work, the relationships between the householders and their servants, and how people used to cook. He took us back to his early childhood when he was having Ratha-yatra and worshipping Radha-Govinda. Then he looked at us very strongly and said, "Whatever I am doing now I was doing then. Do you understand?" We were speechless. Prabhupada said, "Never was there a time when I did not know Krishna. Do you understand?" He said it in such a way that it was clearly the case. That was a very powerful experience.

Transcendental Cheater
----------------------
**Badrinarayana:** When Prabhupada walked through the gorgeous building in Detroit, in the front lobby there was a painting of naked women bathing, and all the sannyasis were trying to be proper about things. Prabhupada looked at the painting, turned to them and said, "Very nicely done." Then they came to a big polar bear rug that had the polar bear's head and teeth. Srila Prabhupada looked at it, gingerly put the tip of his cane in its mouth, lifted it up, looked at the teeth, and, wide-eyed like a child, turned to Jagadish Maharaj and asked, "They eat men?" Jagadish Maharaj said, "Sometimes, Srila Prabhupada." Prabhupada put it down and made a wide berth to walk around it. It was sublime.
The man was asking close to a million dollars for the building. Prabhupada said, "Every room is worth a million dollars. Krishna engaged a rich person to build this building for us, and it's simply been waiting for us to pick it up." Prabhupada walked through the whole thing as if he could pull the money out of his bead bag. Price wasn't an issue when Prabhupada was talking about this and that, but actually he had no money for this project.
Outside there was a sunken garden, and Prabhupada and the man, who was very greedy, were peacefully sitting in the sun in the grotto area. Srila Prabhupada loved the building, and in his sublime, aristocratic way, Prabhupada said, "This building is perfect for our purposes. Every room is exquisite. It's exactly what we want. It's a very aristocratic building." The man could taste the money. Prabhupada said to him, "But we are not aristocrats, we are professional beggars. Therefore you should give it to us." I thought the man was going to have a cardiac arrest. Prabhupada toyed with him back and forth, and ultimately Prabhupada got the building. Ambarish gave half the money and Lekhasravanti gave the other half of the money. In this way, although Prabhupada had nothing but his desire, Krishna arranged the building, and Prabhupada picked it up. No one could believe the price that Prabhupada got it for. In fact, after the papers were signed, a neighbor called to say that the man was stripping the building. He was taking the mirrors off the walls, the doorknobs, the light fixtures, because everything was very opulent. We stopped him and said, "How can you do this?" He said, "I can't help it. Your swami cheated me." Later on we told Prabhupada the story and Prabhupada said, "Yes, I am a Calcutta boy." That man met his match in Srila Prabhupada.

Transcendental Purport
----------------------
**Badrinarayana:** Every morning in Los Angeles Prabhupada taught us the Sanskrit for Sri Isopanisad, "Om purnam adah purnam idam." He would wait for us to say it, and we would stumble. Only a couple of devotees were learning it. After a week or so Prabhupada said, "These books I am writing are not just for selling, they are also for you. You should learn them." He said we should know his books like a lawyer knows the law books.
Another time Prabhupada was reading from Krishna Book and sometimes adding things that weren't in the text. He described how Narada Muni warned Kamsa that any son could be the eighth son of Devaki. Kamsa was waiting for the eighth son to be born and was letting the other sons go. Narada Muni, however, wanted to speed up Krishna's appearance, so Prabhupada said that Narada Muni showed Kamsa how to count in such a way that Kamsa became bewildered and therefore wanted to kill all of Devaki's children.

You don't know a lot
--------------------
**Govinda:** There was a picture of Prahlad Maharaj sitting in boiling oil, and I had to come up with some demons for the picture. I didn't know what demons looked like, but somehow I drew demons. I asked Prabhupada if they were okay. He said, "Yes, this is very good. There are such demons. They are like this. Yes. Even on this planet there are such demons." I said, "Oh, really? I didn't know that." He looked at me and said, "There are a lot of things you do not know."

She has become advanced
-----------------------
**Govinda:** I would open Prabhupada's mail and read it to him. Once Harsharani sent Prabhupada a poem she had written. I thought it was bizarre. She wrote, "I offer my humble obeisances to my spiritual master, who is continuously running here and there playing hide-and-go-seek and leap frog with Krishna and the cowherd boys," and she described many transcendental pastimes. Prabhupada said, "Ah, she has become advanced. Publish this poem in Back to Godhead." And it was printed in Back to Godhead.

Meeting with Indira Gandhi
--------------------------
**Jayapataka Swami:** I was there with some other devotees when Srila Prabhupada went to meet Indira Gandhi. Prabhupada had a list of things he wanted to discuss with Indira Gandhi, but at that time she was very upset because the President of Bangladesh, Muziba Raman, had just been assassinated. Still she made time for Prabhupada to see her on a Thursday afternoon. Prabhupada didn't consult with astrologers much, but he didn't want to have an important meeting on a Thursday afternoon. He said that it was not an auspicious time. That was about the only astrological thing he observed. He said, "Either in the morning or the evening, but not in the afternoon." So they changed the time, and we all went together. But the devotees with Prabhupada only got as far as the door. Indira Gandhi came and met Prabhupada, and he went on alone to talk with her. Later he said that she was very respectful to him. She actually asked him, "How do you know that your followers are not CIA agents?" He explained, "I went to the West and preached. These people have sacrificed everything. They gave up their bad habits. They are getting up at four in the morning, attending mangal arati. If they were CIA, they would live in five star hotels and have a whole different lifestyle. They wouldn't be vegetarians and give up all these habits." She was convinced and said, "All right, I will give your devotees long-term visas." After that meeting she passed some order, and the devotees who needed long-term visas got them.

Transcendental bravery
----------------------
**Badrinarayana:** We were walking by big houses in Letcho Park in Chicago when an enormous dog came running toward us. Three or four devotees hid behind cars, and a couple of devotees hid behind Brahmananda. Everyone was overwhelmed by the bodily concept of life and the thought of self-preservation. Prabhupada was left out to confront his appointment. Everyone else was stunned and didn't know what to do. With transcendental bravery Srila Prabhupada stepped forward and threw his chaddar over his shoulder. It was like Krishna tying His belt before He fights with a demon. Prabhupada took his cane and went "Huttt!" and that huge dog turned and went back. The devotees dusted themselves off and regrouped, a little embarrassed. A little further down the road another dog came out. Some sannyasi tried "Huttt!" but the dog became madder. Prabhupada laughed and said, "You have to know the science."

Viewing the world through Krishna's eyes
----------------------------------------
**Govinda:** We were sitting in the garden in New Jersey one day when we saw a slug crawling right next to Prabhupada. A slug is an ugly thing, like a snail without a shell. I said, "Ooo! Look." I was a kid. Prabhupada got a look of tremendous compassion on his face and said, "Chant to the poor creature." He had me sitting there chanting to this slug. I still chant to slugs or little insects or whatever, because I remember Prabhupada telling me to chant to that slug, and I take it as one of Prabhupada's instructions. We're given this human form of life, we can chant and they can't. But the soul can hear. The tree can hear, the bird can hear. Prabhupada would sit outdoors and talk this way.
Once he was talking about two butterflies that were flying together, and he said, "Just see, there is also family life in the butterfly's world." We were on the beach in New Jersey, and there were little ants on the beach, and he said, "They say there is no life on the moon, but here on the beach we see there is life. There is life in every part of God's creation." He was constantly viewing the world through the vision of Krishna-bhakti. There was never any time that he wasn't seeing in that way.

I have given my sons
--------------------
**Brahmananda:** I had been home to visit my mother, and she knew we were strict vegetarians. We wouldn't eat the food that she cooked because the pots were contaminated, and she was contaminated. The whole house was contaminated. She said, "Hey, what's happening here?" One evening just before the kirtan she went to visit Prabhupada to see what we were getting into.
Prabhupada had a folding metal chair in his room, which was meant for VIPs who couldn't sit on the floor. My mother sat on this chair. Everyone else, including Prabhupada, sat on the floor. She asked Prabhupada, "What are you doing with my boys?" After explaining and preaching, Prabhupada told her, "I am taking care of your sons," because by that time Gargamuni and I had moved into the storefront. "I am feeding them, looking after them, and providing. Actually, we have no income here. Maybe you would like to give some donation?" My mother looked at us, looked at Prabhupada, and said, "Donation? I have already given a donation. I have donated my sons." Prabhupada said, "Oh, yes, very good." By her saying that, it was as if she gave us to Prabhupada.
