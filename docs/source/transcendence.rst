Transcendence
=============

I never forgot Krishna
----------------------
**Hridayananda Goswami:** Karandhar and I were in Prabhupada's room in the early seventies. It was a beautiful afternoon, a breeze was blowing, the sun was setting and golden rays were shining on Prabhupada. It was a sublime atmosphere. Prabhupada began to talk about India at the turn of the century. He explained how people used to work, the relationships between the householders and their servants, and how people used to cook. He took us back to his early childhood when he was having Ratha-yatra and worshipping Radha-Govinda. Then he looked at us very strongly and said, "Whatever I am doing now I was doing then. Do you understand?" We were speechless. Prabhupada said, "Never was there a time when I did not know Krishna. Do you understand?" He said it in such a way that it was clearly the case. That was a very powerful experience.

Transcendental Cheater
----------------------
**Badrinarayana:** When Prabhupada walked through the gorgeous building in Detroit, in the front lobby there was a painting of naked women bathing, and all the sannyasis were trying to be proper about things. Prabhupada looked at the painting, turned to them and said, "Very nicely done." Then they came to a big polar bear rug that had the polar bear's head and teeth. Srila Prabhupada looked at it, gingerly put the tip of his cane in its mouth, lifted it up, looked at the teeth, and, wide-eyed like a child, turned to Jagadish Maharaj and asked, "They eat men?" Jagadish Maharaj said, "Sometimes, Srila Prabhupada." Prabhupada put it down and made a wide berth to walk around it. It was sublime.
The man was asking close to a million dollars for the building. Prabhupada said, "Every room is worth a million dollars. Krishna engaged a rich person to build this building for us, and it's simply been waiting for us to pick it up." Prabhupada walked through the whole thing as if he could pull the money out of his bead bag. Price wasn't an issue when Prabhupada was talking about this and that, but actually he had no money for this project.
Outside there was a sunken garden, and Prabhupada and the man, who was very greedy, were peacefully sitting in the sun in the grotto area. Srila Prabhupada loved the building, and in his sublime, aristocratic way, Prabhupada said, "This building is perfect for our purposes. Every room is exquisite. It's exactly what we want. It's a very aristocratic building." The man could taste the money. Prabhupada said to him, "But we are not aristocrats, we are professional beggars. Therefore you should give it to us." I thought the man was going to have a cardiac arrest. Prabhupada toyed with him back and forth, and ultimately Prabhupada got the building. Ambarish gave half the money and Lekhasravanti gave the other half of the money. In this way, although Prabhupada had nothing but his desire, Krishna arranged the building, and Prabhupada picked it up. No one could believe the price that Prabhupada got it for. In fact, after the papers were signed, a neighbor called to say that the man was stripping the building. He was taking the mirrors off the walls, the doorknobs, the light fixtures, because everything was very opulent. We stopped him and said, "How can you do this?" He said, "I can't help it. Your swami cheated me." Later on we told Prabhupada the story and Prabhupada said, "Yes, I am a Calcutta boy." That man met his match in Srila Prabhupada.

Transcendental Purport
----------------------
**Badrinarayana:** Every morning in Los Angeles Prabhupada taught us the Sanskrit for Sri Isopanisad, "Om purnam adah purnam idam." He would wait for us to say it, and we would stumble. Only a couple of devotees were learning it. After a week or so Prabhupada said, "These books I am writing are not just for selling, they are also for you. You should learn them." He said we should know his books like a lawyer knows the law books.
Another time Prabhupada was reading from Krishna Book and sometimes adding things that weren't in the text. He described how Narada Muni warned Kamsa that any son could be the eighth son of Devaki. Kamsa was waiting for the eighth son to be born and was letting the other sons go. Narada Muni, however, wanted to speed up Krishna's appearance, so Prabhupada said that Narada Muni showed Kamsa how to count in such a way that Kamsa became bewildered and therefore wanted to kill all of Devaki's children.
